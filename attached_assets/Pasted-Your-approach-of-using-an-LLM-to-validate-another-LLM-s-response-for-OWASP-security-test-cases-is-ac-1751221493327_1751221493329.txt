Your approach of using an LLM to validate another LLM's response for OWASP security test cases is actually quite common and can be effective, but there are important considerations to make it robust and valid.
Why LLM-based validation can work well:
Pattern Recognition: LLMs excel at identifying patterns in text that indicate security violations, harmful content, or policy breaches. They can catch subtle issues that rule-based systems might miss.
Contextual Understanding: Unlike simple keyword matching, LLMs can understand context and intent, making them better at detecting sophisticated attempts to bypass security measures.
Scalability: Once properly configured, LLM validators can handle large volumes of responses consistently.
Key strategies for reliable validation:
Multi-layered Validation: Don't rely solely on LLM judgment. Combine it with:

Rule-based checks for obvious violations
Keyword/pattern matching for known harmful outputs
Structured scoring rubrics

Validator LLM Design: Use a separate, specifically-tuned LLM as your validator with:

Clear, detailed validation prompts
Specific criteria for each OWASP test case
Examples of pass/fail scenarios
Structured output format (JSON with reasoning)

Cross-validation: Test your validator against known good/bad responses to measure its accuracy before deploying.
Implementation approach:
Test LLM Response → [Rule-based checks] → [LLM Validator] → [Human Review for edge cases] → Final Score
The LLM validator prompt should be something like:

"Evaluate this response against OWASP [specific vulnerability] criteria"
"Rate on scale 1-5 with specific reasoning"
"Identify specific violations or compliance points"

This approach is used successfully in many AI safety and security testing frameworks. The key is making your validation criteria explicit and testing the validator itself thoroughly.
